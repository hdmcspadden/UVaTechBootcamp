```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is the example in TechBootcamp

```{r examplepipeline}
# load tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Part 1: Read data into data frame
df <- read_csv("andre.csv", col_names = TRUE)

# Part 2: remove data from 1976 and after 1993
df <- filter(df, Year != 1976)
df <- filter(df, Year <  1994)

# Part 3: make a histogram
ggplot(data=df, aes(df$H)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
